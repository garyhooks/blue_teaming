Checklist for SOC while Ransomware attack

While dealing with a ransomware attack in a Security Operations Center (SOC), consider the following checklist:

1# Isolate Infected Systems: Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent the ransomware from spreading further.

2#.Alert Management: Notify relevant stakeholders, including management, legal, and IT teams, about the attack.

3#.Gather Information: Document all available information about the attack, including the ransom note, malware samples, and affected systems.

4#. Engage Incident Response Team: If available, involve your incident response team to lead the investigation and recovery efforts.

5#.Assessment: Determine the scope and impact of the attack on your systems and data.

#6. Containment: Identify the ransomware variant and apply appropriate measures to contain the attack, such as disabling compromised accounts or network segments.

7# Data Backup Check: Verify the integrity of your data backups to ensure they are not compromised. Use clean backup data for recovery.

#8. Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan for informing employees, customers, and partners about the situation, while adhering to legal and regulatory requirements.

9#. Malware Analysis: Conduct analysis on the ransomware to understand its behavior, possible decryption methods, and potential vulnerabilities.

10# Engage Law Enforcement: If necessary, involve law enforcement agencies and share relevant information with them.

11#. Recovery Strategy: Develop a recovery strategy based on the nature of the attack, whether it's possible to decrypt files, or if you need to rebuild systems from scratch.

12#. Negotiation Consideration: Evaluate the risks and benefits of negotiating with the attackers for decryption keys. This is a complex decision with legal and ethical considerations.

13# User Education: Reinforce user education on cybersecurity practices to prevent future attacks.

14# Patch and Update: Identify and patch vulnerabilities that were exploited to deliver the ransomware.

15# Monitor and Analyze: Continuously monitor for signs of the ransomware reactivating or any new vulnerabilities being exploited.

16# Forensics: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand how the attack occurred and whether any data was exfiltrated.

17# Post-Incident Review: After the attack is contained, conduct a review of the incident response process to identify areas for improvement.

18# Risk Mitigation: Implement security measures to prevent similar attacks in the future, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, email filtering, and user training.
